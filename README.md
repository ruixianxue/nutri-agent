# 🌿 NutriAgent AI

**Your Personal AI Nutrition Consultant**

> *Eat Smarter, Live Better.*

NutriAgent AI is an open-source, privacy-focused web application that helps you make safer food choices. By combining computer vision, real-time food databases, and Google's Gemini 2.5 AI, it analyzes ingredients against your specific health profile (like Diabetes, Hypertension, or Allergies).

## 🚀 Why try this?

*   **It's Personal:** Unlike generic Google searches, this agent knows *your* health context.
*   **It's Free:** Runs entirely on the free tier of Google Gemini API.
*   **It's Private:** Built with a **"Bring Your Own Key"** architecture. Your health data and API key live in your browser's local storage and are never sent to our servers.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **📷 Scan & Analyze:** Snap a photo of a barcode or food package to get instant insights.
*   **🧬 Custom Health Profile:** Set up conditions (e.g., "Peanut Allergy", "High Cholesterol") and goals (e.g., "Low Sugar").
*   **🤖 Dual-Agent Intelligence:**
    *   **Orchestrator:** Finds the product and ingredients.
    *   **Consultant:** Reads the ingredients like a doctor to give you a "SAFE", "CAUTION", or "AVOID" verdict.
*   **💡 Smart Recommendations:** Gets warnings about specific ingredients and suggestions for healthier alternatives.
